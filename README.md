It seems like you're working on an HTML project, and you also asked for a "good readme" earlier. I'll help you with that!

Here's a sample README for your project:

Accessibility Quiz Practice Project
This project is a practice quiz designed to improve understanding of HTML, CSS, and web accessibility. It focuses on creating an accessible and user-friendly web form using proper HTML semantics, CSS for styling, and accessibility best practices like keyboard shortcuts and reduced motion for users with disabilities.

Features
Responsive Design: Adjusts to different screen sizes using the viewport meta tag.
Accessible Navigation: Each navigation link has an access key for quick keyboard navigation.
Reduced Motion: Uses the prefers-reduced-motion media query to avoid smooth scrolling animations for users who prefer reduced motion.
Accessible Form: Form elements are associated with labels for better accessibility, and fieldset/legend elements are used to group related questions.
Keyboard Shortcuts: Navigation links have assigned accesskey attributes, improving usability for keyboard users.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and semantics of the page.
CSS3: For styling the page, making it visually appealing and responsive.
ARIA Roles: Ensures that screen readers can correctly interpret sections of the form.
Media Queries: Adjust the scrolling behavior based on user preferences.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the quiz.
Optionally, edit the styles in the styles.css file to customize the appearance.
Accessibility Considerations
Reduced Motion: The project utilizes the @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) media query to apply smooth scrolling only when the user has not requested reduced motion.
